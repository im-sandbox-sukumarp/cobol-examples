MOTTO - Python Implementation

A creative program that displays "GnuCOBOL" - the motto of GnuCOBOL programmers.
This is a simplified Python version of the original creative COBOL implementation.

Original COBOL Program: motto.cbl
Converted from specification: motto-spec.md

Note: The original COBOL program uses creative and unconventional syntax
to demonstrate language flexibility. This Python version preserves the
spirit while using standard Python idioms.
